<p>Kenza BOUBAKRI, summer 2019 :</p>
<p>During my internship at the Institute of Smart Systems and Robotics in Paris, I had to harvest a trajectory draw on a tablet by a user and make the robot Cozmo follow it in the real world.<br>
After a certain number of trials, I found the “follow the Carrot” algorithm which presented the best results.<br>
Here is the implementation of this algorithm.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>To install all the dependencies, run :</p>
<pre class=" language-bash"><code class="prism  language-bash">pip <span class="token function">install</span> --user requirements.txt
</code></pre>
<p>if you have the error :</p>
<pre><code>Could not find any downloads that satisfy the requirement somepackage
</code></pre>
<p>try :</p>
<pre class=" language-bash"><code class="prism  language-bash">pip <span class="token function">install</span> --upgrade -r requirements.txt
</code></pre>
<h2 id="working-with-cozmo">Working with Cozmo</h2>
<p>If it’s the first time you’re working with Cozmo, I would recommand you’ll have a look at the <a href="http://cozmosdk.anki.com/docs/?_ga=1.89134047.533288856.1488180913">Cozmo’s guide</a> to install its sdk.</p>
<p>Then, don’t forget to activate the Cozmo environment :</p>
<pre class=" language-bash"><code class="prism  language-bash"><span class="token function">source</span> ~/cozmo-env/bin/activate
</code></pre>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Once everything is install and you’ve set up the communication between a phone and the Cozmo, you can run the program :</p>
<pre class=" language-bash"><code class="prism  language-bash">python3 run.py
</code></pre>
<h2 id="graphic-user-interface-gui">Graphic User Interface (GUI)</h2>
<p>When the code is running, you will see on the screen a real time visualisation of the robot and the path it should follow.<br>

The blue point is the robot. The red points connected by black lines are the points of the trajectory. If an orange point appears, it means that the direction of the robot must be corrected at the next iteration and this point represent its next target postion.</p>
<h2 id="principle-of-the-algorithm">Principle of the algorithm</h2>
<h4 id="reverse-kinematics">Reverse Kinematics</h4>
<p>To predict the next position of the robot, we need to know its linear and angular speed. But the only instructions we can give to the robot is the speed of each of its wheels. So we need to found a way to switch from one to another of these configurations. To do so, we will use the reverse kinematics of the robot.<br>

Once v and w are computed, we can find vx and vy :<br>

with theta the current orientation of the robot.</p>
<h2 id="improvements">Improvements</h2>
<p>On this version, the robot can still go off the track for certain trajectories, especially if the angle between two sub path is important. You can modify the code and see by yourself how the different parameters of the algorithm change the behaviour of the robot and how it can improve its path following behaviour :</p>
